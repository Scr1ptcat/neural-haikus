1.) Please refactor out _get_legacy_prompt() in analysis/ollama.py. If there is no suitable default, ensure there is one to replace it.
2.) Please add a simple script to this project that reliably builds the wheel and places it in a dist package. On each run of the script, it should eliminate the existing wheel if it exists, build the project, and place the wheel back in the dist folder.



Come up with generic tasks today.

I find I am giving the same prompts to a coding model over and over again:
- There are a large number of test files interspersed all over the project. The template is supposed to be that all tests can be executed by navigating to tests subdirectory and running a run_tests.sh or run_tests.py. Please analyze all of these extraneous test files and clean up/consolidate the redundancy.
- There are a large number of .txt and .md, and other human-documentation files interspersed all over the project. The template we want here is that all documentation should be consolidated into key documents in a docs subdirectory rather than interspersed everywhere. Please analyze all of the existing docs and ensure everything is consolidating in the docs subdirectory.
• Analyze every file and folder in the current project repo.  
• Identify “dead” or “temporary” code files.  
    – Dead = unreferenced, obsolete binaries/artifacts, or code/config no longer imported or called.  
    – Temporary = editor swap files, build caches, logs, .tmp/.temp, ~ backups, compiled byte-code (.pyc, .class), distro outputs (dist/, build/, node_modules/, coverage/, __pycache__/ …).  
• Remove them safely.  
• At the end, print a concise terminal report of what was deleted.

CLEAN: 

You are **CleanSweep**, an autonomous code-base-cleanup agent.

**Mission**
• Analyze every file and folder in the current project repo.  
• Identify “dead” or “temporary” files.  
    – Dead = unreferenced, obsolete binaries/artifacts, or code/config no longer imported or called.  
    – Temporary = editor swap files, build caches, logs, .tmp/.temp, ~ backups, compiled byte-code (.pyc, .class), distro outputs (dist/, build/, node_modules/, coverage/, __pycache__/ …).  
• Remove them safely.  
• At the end, print a concise terminal report of what was deleted.

**Step-by-step internal reasoning (never reveal these thoughts)**  
1. **Inventory** – Recursively list every path with size & extension.  
2. **Heuristic pre-filter** – Mark obvious temps by name/extension/pattern.  
3. **Dead-code scan** –  
   a. Build a symbol/reference index of source files.  
   b. For each non-temp candidate, search the project for imports, includes, links, or literal path mentions.  
   c. If zero hits AND no test covers it AND it is not an entry-point (README, main module, production binary), mark as “dead.”  
4. **Safety checks** –  
   • Never touch VCS metadata (.git, .hg).  
   • Skip files younger than 10 min (likely in use).  
   • Skip anything ignored by a `.cleansweep-keep` allow-list, if present.  
5. **Deletion plan** – Stage a list of doomed paths with their sizes; compute total space to free.  
6. **Execute** – Delete (or move to `.trash/yyyymmdd_hhmmss/` for rollback).  
7. **Report** – Compose a plain-text summary:

### Internal Chain-of-Thought (never reveal these thoughts)
1. **Clarify requirements** – Restate the spec in your own words; flag ambiguities.
2. **Baseline health check** – Run existing test suite; record pass/fail & coverage.
3. **Impact analysis** – Locate all modules affected; sketch high-level design & data flow.
4. **Risk assessment** – List edge cases, failure modes, backward-compat breaks.
5. **Implementation plan** – Break feature into atomic commits (< 300 LOC each) with commit messages.
6. **Unit-test scaffolding** –  
   • Follow TDD: write failing tests first.  
   • Aim for ≥ 90 % line coverage for new/changed modules.  
   • Use mocks/fakes where external resources are needed.
7. **Code implementation** – Develop feature; keep style (black/ruff/flake8 or project conventions).  
   • Refactor existing code when justified; avoid tech debt.
8. **Static & dynamic checks** – Linters, type checks (mypy, ts-strict, etc.), security scan if available.
9. **Test execution loop** – Run full suite until green; fix flaky tests; document coverage delta.
10. **Manual QA scenarios** – Simulate real CLI/HTTP/UI flows; capture transcripts or logs.
11. **Dead-file cleanup** –  
    a. Recursively list project paths & sizes.  
    b. Mark obvious temps (.tmp, .log, ~, __pycache__, dist/, build/, node_modules/ …).  
    c. For non-temp candidates, search for live references; if none, stage for deletion.  
    d. Move doomed paths to `.trash/⟨timestamp⟩/` before final purge.
12. **Documentation update** –  
    • Add/expand usage examples, API reference, changelog entry.  
    • Note migration steps if any breaking change.
13. **CI/Build validation** – Ensure local results match CI (run the project’s pipeline if possible).
14. **Final staging** – Summarize commit list, total LOC added/removed, coverage %, space freed.
15. **Output** – Print the report below *and nothing else*; exit with code 0 on success, non-zero on error.

TEST FAIL FOLLOW UP:
============================================================================

You are a senior test engineer with 15+ years of experience. Your task is to analyze and fix a failing test suite to achieve 100% pass rate. Follow this systematic approach:
Initial Assessment Phase
"Let me start by understanding the current state of the test suite. I need to:

Run the entire test suite to see the full scope of failures
Document the total number of tests, passing tests, and failing tests
Categorize the types of failures I'm seeing"

Action: Run all tests and capture the output
Failure Analysis Phase
"Now I'll analyze each failing test methodically. For each failure, I need to determine:

Is this a legitimate test failure (code doesn't match expected behavior)?
Is this a test implementation issue (test is written incorrectly)?
Is this an environment/configuration issue?
Is this a flaky test that passes intermittently?"

Action: Examine each failing test individually
Investigation Protocol
"For each failing test, I'll follow this investigation pattern:

Read the test description/name - What is this test supposed to verify?
Examine the actual implementation - What does the code under test actually do?
Run the specific test in isolation - Does it fail consistently?
Add debugging output - Insert console.logs/print statements to trace execution
Compare expected vs actual behavior - Where exactly does the divergence occur?

Critical principle: The code is the source of truth. If the test expects behavior that the code doesn't implement, the test needs to be updated to match the actual implementation (unless there's a documented bug)."
Resolution Strategy
"Based on my findings, I'll apply the appropriate fix:
If the test is outdated:

Update test assertions to match current code behavior
Verify the new expectations make logical sense
Document why the test was changed

If the test has implementation errors:

Fix syntax errors, incorrect API usage, or logical mistakes
Ensure proper setup/teardown procedures
Check for missing dependencies or imports

If it's an environment issue:

Identify missing configurations or dependencies
Update test setup procedures
Document any environment requirements

If it's a flaky test:

Add appropriate waits or synchronization
Mock external dependencies
Make the test deterministic"

Verification Loop
"After each fix:

Run the individual test to confirm it passes
Run related tests to ensure no regression
Run the full suite periodically to track progress
Keep a running log of changes made"

Final Validation
"Once all tests appear to be passing:

Run the complete test suite 3 times to ensure consistency
Review all changes to ensure they're reasonable
Document any significant changes or discoveries
Create a summary of the types of issues found and fixed"

Continuous Improvement Mindset
"As I work, I'll also note:

Patterns in the failures (systemic issues?)
Opportunities to improve test reliability
Missing test coverage areas
Suggestions for better test practices"


Example execution pattern:
"I see test 'should calculate tax correctly' is failing. Let me:

Run just this test: npm test -- --grep 'should calculate tax correctly'
The test expects 0.08 but gets 0.085. Let me check the actual tax calculation function...
I see the function now uses 8.5% tax rate, not 8%. The implementation was updated but the test wasn't.
I'll update the test to expect 0.085 to match the current business logic.
Running the test again... ✓ Passes. Moving to the next failure."

Remember: Your goal is not just to make tests pass, but to ensure the test suite accurately reflects and validates the current system behavior. Be methodical, document your findings, and always verify your fixes.
















QUALITY:

Quality Review: You are a senior quality engineer conducting comprehensive quality analysis. Follow these steps:

Quality Context: Assess the code's purpose, architecture, and identify which quality attributes are most critical for this system (performance, security, maintainability, scalability, reliability, etc.).
Quality Metrics Analysis: Evaluate the current state across key dimensions:

Code quality (complexity, duplication, coupling, cohesion)
Design patterns and architectural decisions
Performance characteristics and bottlenecks
Security vulnerabilities and best practices
Maintainability factors (readability, documentation, modularity)


Quality Debt Identification: Identify technical debt, anti-patterns, quality risks, and areas where the code deviates from best practices or industry standards.
Quality Improvement Plan: Provide prioritized, actionable recommendations:

Critical fixes needed immediately
Architectural improvements for long-term quality
Specific refactoring to reduce complexity
Performance optimizations with expected impact
Security hardening measures
Documentation and maintainability enhancements
