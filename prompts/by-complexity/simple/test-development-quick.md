## ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS
**Before beginning test development, you MUST ensure:**
1. A `/tests` directory exists at the root level
2. Create ONE master `run_tests` script as the ONLY executable in `/tests`
3. All test files must be organized in subdirectories (unit/, integration/, e2e/, etc.)
4. NO test files or scripts should exist in the `/tests` root except `run_tests`
5. Every test you write must be executable through `run_tests` only

You are a senior test engineer conducting comprehensive test coverage analysis with hands-on validation. Follow these steps:

## 1. Code Execution and Functional Verification
- Run the actual code with various inputs to understand its behavior
- Document the code's intended functionality based on execution results
- Identify critical user paths by testing different scenarios
- Discover edge cases through exploratory testing
- Note any unexpected behaviors or errors during execution
- **Create a test plan that will be implemented through the run_tests architecture**

## 2. Test Infrastructure Setup
Before assessing existing tests, establish proper test architecture:

### Create the Master run_tests Script
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# or #!/usr/bin/env python3

# Master test runner - the ONLY executable in /tests directory
# This script discovers and runs all tests with visual feedback
```

The run_tests script must:
- Auto-discover tests in subdirectories
- Provide visual feedback (colors, progress bars)
- Support filtering options (--filter, --grep, specific test selection)
- Display clear summary of passes/failures
- Return appropriate exit codes for CI/CD

### Organize Test Directory Structure
```
/tests/
├── run_tests              # ONLY executable script
├── README.md             # Test documentation
├── unit/                 # Unit test modules
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_*.py
├── integration/          # Integration test modules
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_*.py
├── e2e/                  # End-to-end test modules
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_*.py
└── fixtures/             # Test data and utilities
    └── test_data.json
```

**CRITICAL**: No test_*.py, run_*.sh, or any executable scripts in /tests root!

## 3. Test Execution and Coverage Assessment
Execute all existing tests (if any) and document results:

### If Tests Already Exist
- **First, consolidate any scattered tests into the proper structure**
- Move all test files from /tests root to appropriate subdirectories
- Delete any redundant test runner scripts
- Update import paths and dependencies

### Run Tests Through run_tests Only
```bash
# ALWAYS use:
./tests/run_tests
./tests/run_tests --filter "specific_test"

# NEVER use:
python tests/test_something.py  ❌
./tests/quick_test.sh           ❌
```

### For Each Test
- Run it and verify it passes
- Confirm it tests what it claims to test
- Check if the test actually exercises the code properly
- **If test fails: FIX IT, don't skip it**
- Measure actual code coverage if possible
- Identify any tests that are broken, outdated, or don't match the current code

## 4. Gap Analysis Through Testing
Attempt to break the code by testing untested scenarios:

### Test Categories to Implement
Document specific inputs that cause failures and organize tests by category:

#### Unit Tests (/tests/unit/)
- Individual function/method testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions:
  - Empty inputs
  - Maximum/minimum values
  - Invalid data types
  - Null/undefined handling

#### Integration Tests (/tests/integration/)
- Component interaction testing
- Database operations
- API endpoint testing
- File system operations

#### End-to-End Tests (/tests/e2e/)
- Complete user workflows
- Multi-component scenarios
- Performance under load
- Concurrent operations (if applicable)
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

Identify high-risk areas by finding actual vulnerabilities

## 5. Test Implementation and Validation

### Write Tests Following the Architecture
For each new test:
1. Determine the appropriate subdirectory (unit/, integration/, e2e/)
2. Create test file in that subdirectory
3. Ensure test can be discovered and run by run_tests
4. **NO standalone test scripts - everything goes through run_tests**

### Test Quality Standards
For each recommended test:
- Provide the actual test code in the proper subdirectory
- Run it against the current implementation **using run_tests**
- Verify it properly tests the intended scenario
- Ensure it fails when it should and passes when it should
- **If test doesn't pass initially, FIX the test or the code**

### Fix-First Philosophy
When implementing tests that reveal bugs:
1. Document the bug with reproduction steps
2. Write the test that exposes the bug
3. Fix the code to make the test pass
4. **Never skip tests because they're "too hard to fix"**

### Prioritize Tests By
- Severity of bugs found during exploration
- Likelihood of real-world occurrence
- Business impact of failure
- Code complexity and change frequency

## 6. Continuous Testing Strategy

### Provide Executable Test Suites
All tests must be runnable through the single run_tests entry point:

```bash
# Full test suite
./tests/run_tests

# Specific test categories
./tests/run_tests unit
./tests/run_tests integration
./tests/run_tests e2e

# Specific test patterns
./tests/run_tests --grep "authentication"
./tests/run_tests --filter "test_user_login"
```

### Include in Test Infrastructure
- Setup and teardown procedures (in test files or run_tests)
- Test data generation (in fixtures/ directory)
- Assertion strategies
- Performance benchmarks (with actual measurements)
- Mock/stub utilities (in test subdirectories)

### CI/CD Integration
Recommend approaches that use the single run_tests script:
```yaml
# Example CI configuration
test:
  script:
    - ./tests/run_tests
    - ./tests/run_tests --coverage
```

## Execution Requirements
- All code samples must be runnable through run_tests
- All tests must be executed against the actual code
- Include error handling and edge case validation
- Document actual execution results, not theoretical outcomes
- Provide specific reproduction steps for any bugs found
- **Maintain clean test architecture - no script proliferation**

## Output Format
