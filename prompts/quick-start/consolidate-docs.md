Objective
Analyze and restructure the project's documentation to follow best practices: all documentation consolidated into a well-organized /docs directory at the root level, with related content merged into concise, unified documents.

Step-by-Step Analysis and Actions
Step 1: Comprehensive Documentation Discovery
Perform a deep scan of the entire repository:

Locate all documentation files
Find all .md files throughout the project
Find all .txt files throughout the project
Include hidden directories but exclude:
.git directory
node_modules, venv, or other dependency directories
Build/dist directories
Create documentation inventory
Path: /path/to/file.md
Size: 2.3KB
Last Modified: 2024-01-15
First 100 chars of content: [preview]
Apparent purpose: [initial classification]
Identify documentation patterns
Note files with similar names across directories (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)
Track directory-specific documentation (e.g., /src/utils/README.md)
Flag auto-generated documentation that should be preserved differently
Step 2: Content Analysis and Categorization
For each discovered document:

Analyze content thoroughly
Read the full content of each file
Identify the primary purpose (setup, API docs, architecture, contributing, etc.)
Extract key topics and subjects covered
Note any code examples, diagrams, or special formatting
Categorize documentation types
Setup/Installation: Getting started, prerequisites, installation steps
Architecture/Design: System design, component relationships, patterns
API/Reference: Function docs, class docs, interface definitions
Development: Contributing guidelines, coding standards, workflows
Operations: Deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting
User Guides: End-user documentation, tutorials, examples
Project Meta: Changelog, license, credits, roadmap
Identify relationships
Which documents reference each other?
Which documents cover overlapping topics?
Which are clearly outdated or superseded?
Which contain duplicate information?
Step 3: Design Consolidated Documentation Structure
Plan the new /docs directory structure:

Core structure design
/docs/
├── README.md          # Docs overview and navigation
├── setup.md           # All setup/installation info
├── architecture.md    # System design and patterns
├── api-reference.md   # Complete API documentation
├── development.md     # Developer guide and standards
├── operations.md      # Deployment and ops guides
└── user-guide.md      # End-user documentation
Consolidation mapping For each category, plan which files will be merged:
List source files that will contribute content
Identify sections that will be created in the consolidated file
Note any content that should be excluded (outdated, redundant)
Special cases
Determine if any docs genuinely need to remain in specific directories
Plan handling of auto-generated documentation
Consider if images/assets need reorganization
Step 4: Create/Update Docs Directory
Establish the documentation foundation:

Ensure /docs exists
Create /docs directory if it doesn't exist
Create subdirectories only if absolutely necessary (e.g., /docs/images)
Create consolidated document templates For each planned consolidated document, create a structure like:
markdown
# [Document Title]

## Table of Contents
- [Section 1]
- [Section 2]
- ...

## Section 1
[Consolidated content]

## Section 2
[Consolidated content]
Step 5: Content Consolidation
Execute the consolidation plan:

For each consolidated document category: a. Extract relevant content
Pull content from all source files identified in the mapping
Remove redundant information (keep the best version)
Preserve important code examples and diagrams
b. Merge intelligently
Combine related sections logically
Ensure smooth transitions between merged content
Maintain consistent formatting and style
Deduplicate information while preserving completeness
c. Enhance organization
Add clear section headers
Create a logical flow from general to specific
Add cross-references where appropriate
Include a table of contents for longer documents
Content quality improvements
Fix broken internal links
Update outdated information discovered during consolidation
Standardize formatting (headers, lists, code blocks)
Ensure consistent terminology throughout
Step 6: Clean Up Scattered Documentation
Remove the now-consolidated files:

Verification before deletion
Confirm all unique content has been preserved in /docs
Check that no critical information was missed
Ensure internal links have been updated
Delete redundant files
Remove all .md and .txt files outside /docs that have been consolidated
Exception: Keep root-level README.md but ensure it links to /docs
Exception: Keep LICENSE, CHANGELOG if at root (these are standard)
Update references
Search for any code or config files that reference old documentation paths
Update CI/CD pipelines that might reference old docs
Fix any external documentation links
Step 7: Create Documentation Index
Build a comprehensive navigation system:

Create /docs/README.md
markdown
# Project Documentation

Welcome to the [Project Name] documentation. All project documentation is organized here for easy access.

## Quick Start
- 📚 [Setup Guide](./setup.md) - Get up and running quickly
- 🏗️ [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) - Understand the system design

## Documentation Index

### For Users
- [User Guide](./user-guide.md) - Complete guide for end users

### For Developers  
- [Development Guide](./development.md) - Contributing and coding standards
- [API Reference](./api-reference.md) - Complete API documentation

### For Operations
- [Operations Guide](./operations.md) - Deployment and maintenance

## Documentation Standards
- All documentation is maintained in this `/docs` directory
- Updates should be made via pull requests
- Keep documentation concise and up-to-date
Update root README.md
Ensure it has a clear link to /docs
Keep only project overview in root README
Move detailed content to appropriate docs
Step 8: Validation and Quality Check
Completeness check
Re-scan the project to ensure no documentation was missed
Verify all categories of documentation are represented
Check that no broken links exist
Readability review
Ensure each consolidated document flows logically
Check that section headers are clear and consistent
Verify code examples are properly formatted
Confirm tables and lists render correctly
Size and organization check
Ensure no single document is too large (split if >100KB)
Verify the structure is intuitive for newcomers
Check that related content is properly grouped
Step 9: Final Documentation Report
Create a summary of the consolidation:

Migration summary

Files analyzed: [X] .md files, [Y] .txt files
Files consolidated: [Z]
Files removed: [W]

New structure:
- /docs/setup.md (consolidated from 8 files)
- /docs/architecture.md (consolidated from 5 files)
- ...

Space saved: [X]KB
Duplicate content removed: ~[Y]%
