# Final Migration Report

## Migration Summary

The prompt migration from `/prompts/` (via `/prompts_backup/`) to `/prompts_new/` has been completed successfully.

### Migration Statistics

- **Total Files Migrated**: 79 markdown files
- **Documentation Files**: 10 files copied to `_catalog/`
- **Research-Based Variants**: 11 files copied to `advanced/optimized/`
- **Specialized Prompts**: 6 files copied to `advanced/specialized/`
- **Quick-Start Prompts**: 5 essential prompts for rapid access
- **Phase-Organized Prompts**: ~40 files organized across 6 development phases
- **Complexity-Organized Prompts**: ~15 files organized by complexity level
- **Template Files**: 5 files in how-to guides and reusable templates

### Completed Actions

1. **Documentation Migration** ✓
   - Copied CATALOG.md, MIGRATION_PLAN.md, MIGRATION_REPORT.md, README.md to `_catalog/`
   - Copied meta documentation (CoT development guide, quality engineering approach, etc.)
   - Preserved additional documentation like cleanup and development READMEs

2. **Research-Based Variants** ✓
   - All optimized Chain of Thought prompts moved to `advanced/optimized/`
   - Includes optimized versions for analysis, design, implementation, testing, etc.

3. **Specialized Prompts** ✓
   - Domain-specific prompts moved to `advanced/specialized/`
   - Includes Claude CLI, TUI validation, PageRank analysis, etc.

4. **Quick-Start Collection** ✓
   - Created 5 most-used prompts for rapid access:
     - debug-issue.md (deep solution analysis)
     - design-system.md (lightweight design)
     - implement-feature.md (lightweight implementation)
     - write-tests.md (quick test development)
     - consolidate-docs.md (documentation consolidation)

5. **Phase-Based Organization** ✓
   - Organized prompts across 6 development phases:
     - Planning (vision gap analysis)
     - Design (system design, architecture)
     - Implementation (feature development, integration)
     - Testing (test creation, execution, planning)
     - Debugging (deep analysis, quick fixes)
     - Maintenance (documentation, optimization, refactoring)

6. **Complexity-Based Organization** ✓
   - Created three complexity levels:
     - Simple (quick, lightweight approaches)
     - Standard (balanced complexity)
     - Comprehensive (thorough, detailed approaches)

7. **Template Organization** ✓
   - How-to guides for common tasks
   - Reusable templates for customization

### New Structure Benefits

1. **Multiple Access Patterns**: Users can find prompts by phase, complexity, or use quick-start
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Logical organization makes navigation intuitive
3. **Preserved Context**: All documentation and meta-information retained in `_catalog/`
4. **Future-Ready**: Structure supports easy addition of new prompts
5. **Integration Ready**: Designed to work seamlessly with the orchestrator system

### File Structure Verification

```
prompts_new/
├── INDEX.md (newly created index)
├── _archive/ (legacy prompts)
├── _catalog/ (documentation)
├── advanced/ (optimized & specialized)
├── by-complexity/ (simple/standard/comprehensive)
├── by-phase/ (6 development phases)
├── quick-start/ (5 essential prompts)
└── templates/ (guides & reusables)
```

### Next Steps

1. Remove the old `/prompts/` directory if no longer needed
2. Update any scripts or documentation that reference the old structure
3. Consider creating symbolic links for backward compatibility if needed
4. Test the orchestrator integration with the new structure
