# Orchestrator: Generate Work Sessions

You are preparing detailed work sessions for feature implementation.

Given a feature request, you will:
1. Analyze what needs to be built
2. Fill out complete analysis and implementation templates
3. Provide time estimates and execution notes

## Current Project Context
You are in a project directory. Quickly scan to understand:
- Project type and language
- Key patterns and conventions
- Similar existing features

## Feature Request: The frontend has a scan Action that is failing with: Scan failed: Failed to trigger scan: Command '['python3', '/home/sabatu/Repositories/project-extractor/extract_project.py', '--format', 'json', '--max-file-size', '1000000', '/home/sabatu/Repositories/project-extractor']' returned non-zero exit status 1. The project should use the built dist from project-extractor instead of trying to hit the code directly. Implement this feature.

## Your Output

Provide THREE sections:

### 1. ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE
```
[Complete filled analysis template with specific focus areas for this feature]
```

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION_TEMPLATE  
```
[Complete filled implementation template with detailed requirements]
```

### 3. EXECUTION_NOTES
```
Time Estimate: [hours]
Key Files: [list]
Similar Features: [if any]
Complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
Risks: [any identified]
```

Be specific and thorough. Someone should be able to execute these templates without additional context.
