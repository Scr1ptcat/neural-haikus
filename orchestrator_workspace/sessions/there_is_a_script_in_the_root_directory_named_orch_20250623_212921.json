    "analysis_output": "  1. Architecture Overview\n\n  System Design Pattern\n\n  The prompt-runner project follows a Modular Command-Line Architecture with these key patterns:\n  - Command Pattern: Each functionality is encapsulated in separate command modules\n  - Repository Pattern: Database operations abstracted through db_ops functions\n  - Service Layer: Business logic separated in modules like workflows/, cache/, optimization/\n  - Plugin Architecture: Commands are dynamically registered via Typer\n\n  Component Organization\n\n  prompt_tool/\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 cli.py                  # Main entry point, command registration\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 commands/               # CLI command implementations\n  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 project_cmds.py    # Project management\n  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 workflow_cmds.py   # Workflow execution (similar to orchestrator)\n  \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 [other_cmds].py    # Other command groups\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 core/                   # Core utilities\n  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 templating.py      # Template engine with variable substitution\n  \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 model_integration.py # LLM integration layer\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 db/                     # Database layer\n  \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 models.py          # SQLAlchemy models\n  \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 db_utils.py        # Database operations\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500 workflows/              # Workflow engine (similar functionality)\n      \u2514\u2500\u2500 engine.py          # Step-by-step execution\n\n  Data Flow\n\n  1.

Code Conventions Document\n\n  Naming Standards\n\n  - Files: snake_case.py (e.g., workflow_cmds.py, template_engine.py)\n  - Command Groups: noun_cmds.py pattern (e.g., project_cmds.py)\n  - Functions: snake_case with verb_noun pattern\n  def create_workflow(name: str, ...)  # Good\n  def list_sessions(project_id: int)   # Good\n  - Classes: PascalCase\n  class WorkflowEngine:\n  class OrchestrationSession(Base):  # SQLAlchemy models\n  - CLI Commands: Verb-noun with hyphens\n  prompt-runner workflow create\n  prompt-runner orchestrate list-sessions  # Proposed\n\n  File Organization Patterns\n\n  - Command modules: All commands in prompt_tool/commands/\n  - One Typer app per command group: Each file exports app = typer.Typer(...)\n  - Related functionality grouped: e.g., all workflow logic in workflows/\n\n  Import/Export Conventions\n\n  # Standard import order (enforced by isort)\n  import os  # stdlib\n  from pathlib import Path\n  from typing import Optional, Dict\n\n  import typer  # third-party\n  from rich.console import Console\n  from sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n\n  from prompt_tool.db.models import Project  # local absolute imports\n  from prompt_tool.core.templating import TemplateEngine\n\n  Error Handling Patterns\n\n  # Consistent error handling via utils\n  try:\n      # operation\n  except Exception as e:\n      handle_command_error(\"creating session\", e)\n\n  # Validation with early exit\n  entity = validate_entity_exists(session, \"Project\", name, db_ops.get_project_by_name)\n\n  Logging Approaches\n\n  - Rich console for user-facing output: console.print(\"[green]\u2713[/green] Success\")\n  - Progress bars for long operations: with Progress() as progress:\n  - Tables for structured data display\n\n  3. Feature Integration Points\n\n  Primary Integration Point: New Command Group\n\n  Create prompt_tool/commands/orchestrate_cmds.py:\n  app = typer.Typer(name=\"orchestrate\", help=\"Feature planning and orchestration\")\n\n  Register in prompt_tool/cli.py:27-39:\n  from prompt_tool.commands import orchestrate_cmds\n  app.add_typer(orchestrate_cmds.app, name=\"orchestrate\", help=\"Feature planning orchestration\")\n\n  Database Schema Extensions\n\n  Add to prompt_tool/db/models.py after line 499:\n  class OrchestrationSession(Base):\n      __tablename__ = 'orchestration_sessions'\n\n      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n      session_id = Column(String(36), unique=True, nullable=False)\n      project_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('projects.id'))\n      feature_request = Column(Text, nullable=False)\n      status = Column(String(20), default='planning')  # planning, analysis, implementation, completed\n\n      # Template storage\n      orchestrator_template = Column(Text)\n      analysis_template = Column(Text)\n      implementation_template = Column(Text)\n      execution_notes = Column(Text)\n\n      # Analysis results\n      analysis_results = Column(Text)\n\n      # Metadata\n      complexity = Column(String(20))  # low, medium, high\n      time_estimate = Column(String(50))\n      created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())\n      updated_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), onupdate=func.now())\n\n      # Relationships\n      project = relationship(\"Project\", backref=\"orchestration_sessions\")\n      executions = relationship(\"Execution\", secondary=\"orchestration_executions\")\n\n  Module Structure\n\n  Create prompt_tool/orchestration/:\n  orchestration/\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 orchestrator.py         # Core logic from original script\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 session_manager.py      # Session lifecycle management\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 template_processor.py   # Template parsing and storage\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500 prompt_builder.py       # Prompt generation for each phase\n\n  Integration with Existing Systems\n\n  1. Leverage Workflow Engine: Use existing WorkflowEngine for multi-step execution\n  2. Template System: Integrate with TemplateEngine for variable substitution\n  3. Model Integration: Use ModelIntegration for LLM calls\n  4. Project Association: Link sessions to projects like other entities\n\n  Files to Modify\n\n  1. prompt_tool/cli.py: Add command registration (line ~39)\n  2. prompt_tool/db/models.py: Add new model (after line 499)\n  3. alembic/versions/: Create new migration for schema\n\n  Potential Conflicts\n\n  - Workflow overlap: Clear distinction needed between workflows and orchestration\n  - Template storage: Large templates may need TEXT columns or file fallback\n  - Session naming: Avoid confusion with database sessions\n\n  4.

Run the orchestration workflow:\n  # Create a planning session\n  prompt-runner orchestrate plan \"Add user authentication\" --project myproject\n\n  # Process LLM output\n  prompt-runner orchestrate process --session <session_id> --file llm_output.txt\n\n  # Generate and run analysis\n  prompt-runner orchestrate analyze --session <session_id>\n  prompt-runner orchestrate save-analysis --session <session_id> --file analysis.txt\n\n  # Generate implementation prompt\n  prompt-runner orchestrate implement --session <session_id>\n\n  # Complete session\n  prompt-runner orchestrate complete --session <session_id>\n\n  # List and view sessions\n  prompt-runner orchestrate list-sessions\n  prompt-runner orchestrate show <session_id>\n  3. Run tests:\n  # Run orchestration tests\n  pytest tests/test_orchestration/\n  pytest tests/test_commands/test_orchestrate_cmds.py\n\n  # Run all tests to ensure no regression\n  pytest tests/\n\n  4. Integration Confirmation\n\n  The implementation:\n  - \u2705 Follows all patterns identified in analysis\n  - \u2705 All new code has tests with comprehensive coverage\n  - \u2705 Error handling matches project standards using handle_command_error\n  - \u2705 Logging follows conventions with Rich console output\n  - \u2705 Documentation is complete with docstrings and type hints\n  - \u2705 No TODO comments remain in the code\n  - \u2705 Production ready with proper validation and error handling\n\n  5. Key Features Integrated\n\n  1. Database Integration:\n    - Sessions stored in PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy\n    - Proper relationships with Projects and Executions\n    - Metadata extraction and storage\n  2. CLI Commands:\n    - plan - Create orchestration session\n    - process - Extract templates from LLM output\n    - analyze - Generate analysis prompt\n    - save-analysis - Store analysis results\n    - implement - Generate implementation prompt\n    - complete - Mark session as completed\n    - list-sessions - View all sessions\n    - show - Show session details\n  3. Rich Output Formatting:\n    - Syntax highlighting for prompts\n    - Progress indicators\n    - Formatted tables for listings\n    - Color-coded status messages\n  4. Error Handling:\n    - Validation for all inputs\n    - Clear error messages\n    - Graceful fallbacks for template parsing\n  5. Testing:\n    - Unit tests for all components\n    - Integration tests for full workflow\n    - CLI tests with mocked dependencies\n    - Edge case coverage\n\n  The orchestrator functionality is now fully integrated into the prompt-runner CLI, maintaining consistency with existing patterns and providing a seamless user\n  experience for feature planning and implementation workflows."
