Implementation Readiness Checklist\n\n  \u2705 Prerequisites Confirmed:\n  - project-extractor has build.sh script\n  - Dist creates wheel at dist/project_extractor-2.1.0-py3-none-any.whl\n  - Scanner uses subprocess pattern amenable to modification\n  - Configuration system supports new variables\n\n  \u2705 Patterns Identified:\n  - Service layer pattern for optional features\n  - Graceful degradation for missing dependencies\n  - Environment-based configuration\n  - Comprehensive error handling with logging\n  - Mock-based testing for external commands\n\n  \u2705 Integration Points Mapped:\n  - scanner.py:_run_extractor() - Primary modification\n  - config.py - New configuration variables\n  - health_check.py - Dist availability checking\n  - New service: extractor_manager.py\n\n  \u26a0\ufe0f Risks Documented:\n  1. No existing file watching pattern - Will need to introduce new dependency\n  2. No automatic update mechanisms - All updates are manual\n  3. Hard-coded version - Currently \"2.0.0\" everywhere\n  4. Virtual environment isolation - Need to handle pip install in correct env\n\n  \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Notes:\n  1. Follow existing subprocess pattern exactly\n  2. Add feature flag for gradual rollout\n  3. Maintain backward compatibility with script mode\n  4. Use existing logging and error patterns\n  5.
